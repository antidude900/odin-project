# The start of my web development journey through The Odin project! #
## I will be documenting my journey here! ##
</br>

### *Day 1* 

#### Started the Foundation Course! Did Introduction, Prerequisites and Git Basics. Actually I learnt Git when i was learning machine learning project. So didn't learn anything new technical stuffs but the introduction section gave me ideas of new learning approach, boosted by motivation and excitement to learn this course further! Really well written and well presented! Loved the approach

</br></br>


### *Day 2* 

#### Started HTML Foundations section! Was simple and not lengthy, so completed the whole section except the project at the end. Decided to do it tommorow as it will act as revision too

</br></br>


### *Day 3* 

#### Before starting the project, got the thought of making notes. But odin project already warned that making notes might only distract and making learning process long than necessary, so rather make notes with references rather than description! Hence made a google sides note where I reference all the topics I learn(Each topic a slide)! Upto List, there was not that much important description, so only saved code snippets. but from link and images started referencing each topic with links

#### Then started doing the project!
