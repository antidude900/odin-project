    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni is dry pasta shaped like narrow tubes. Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni. Some home machines can make macaroni shapes but, like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite sides of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine.</p> 
    <p>The word "macaroni" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy and other countries, the noun maccheroni can refer to straight, tubular, square-ended pasta corta ("short-length pasta") or to long pasta dishes, as in maccheroni alla chitarra and frittata di maccheroni, which are prepared with long pasta like spaghetti. In the United States, federal regulations define three different shapes of dried pasta, such as spaghetti, as a "macaroni product".</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 c. dried macaroni</li>
        <li>1 whole egg</li>
        <li>1/2 stick salted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 c. whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp. (heaping) dry mustard, more if desired</li>
        <li>1 lb. cheese (such as cheddar, jack, and/or fontina), grated</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. seasoned salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the macaroni until very firm. The macaroni should be too firm to eat right out of the pot. Drain.</li> 
      <li>Beat the egg in a small bowl.</li>    
      <li>Melt the butter in a large pot and sprinkle in the flour. Whisk together over medium-low heat. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes, whisking constantly. Don't let it burn. Pour in the milk, add the mustard, and whisk until smooth. Cook for 5 minutes until very thick. Reduce the heat to low.</li>    
      <li>Take 1/4 cup of the sauce and slowly pour it into the beaten egg, whisking constantly to avoid cooking the egg. Whisk together till smooth.</li>    
      <li>Pour the egg mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly. Stir until smooth. Add in the cheese and stir to melt. Add the salt, seasoned salt and pepper. Taste the sauce, adding more salt and seasoned salt as needed. (Do not under-salt!) Pour in the drained, cooked macaroni and stir to combine. Serve immediately; otherwise, pour into a buttered baking dish, top with extra cheese, and bake at 350Ëš for 20 to 25 minutes, then serve.</li>
